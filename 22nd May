# Under the weather
##What does it mean? 
To feel ill

##How do you use it? 
In England we love to talk about the weather and will do so often, but don’t be fooled by this common phrase.
If someone says they’re feeling under the weather, your response should be ‘I hope you feel better!’, not ‘Would you like to borrow my umbrella?’.
